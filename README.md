# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sergii Gurbych

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Jewish Studies and Digital Humanities at Vilnius University. My work focuses on historical handwritten documents, interwar cultural memory, and computational tools for processing Hebrew-script sources.

## ðŸ§  My interests include:

- Yiddish and Hebrew handwritten text recognition (HTR)
- Digital editions of archival materials
- Epistolary networks, youth movements, and Jewish history in Central and Eastern Europe
- Custom HTR model training with Kraken
- OCR, layout analysis, and Digital Humanities infrastructure
